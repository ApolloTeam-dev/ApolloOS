        )

/*  FUNCTION
        Opens the  file whose name is the string pointed to by path  and
        associates  the  stream  pointed to by stream with it.

    INPUTS
        path   - the file to open
        mode   - The mode of the stream  (same as with fopen()) must be com­patible
                 with the mode of the file  descriptor.   The  file
                 position  indicator  of  the  new  stream  is  set to that
                 belonging to fildes, and the error and end-of-file indicators
                 are cleared.  Modes "w" or "w+" do not cause truncation of the
                 file.  The file descriptor is not duplicated,  and
                 will  be  closed  when  the  stream  created  by fdopen is
                 closed.
        stream - the stream to which the file will be associated.

    RESULT
        NULL on error or stream.
