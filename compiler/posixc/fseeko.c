        int __posixc_fseeko (

/*  SYNOPSIS */
        FILE * stream,
        off_t  offset,
        int    whence)

/*  FUNCTION
        Change the current position in a stream.

    INPUTS
        stream - Modify this stream
        offset, whence - How to modify the current position. whence
                can be SEEK_SET, then offset is the absolute position
                in the file (0 is the first byte), SEEK_CUR then the
                position will change by offset (ie. -5 means to move
                5 bytes to the beginning of the file) or SEEK_END.
                SEEK_END means that the offset is relative to the
                end of the file (-1 is the last byte and 0 is
                the EOF).

    RESULT
        0 on success and -1 on error. If an error occurred, the global
        variable errno is set.

    NOTES
        on 32bit platforms, off_t is a 32bit value, and so the 64bit
        version (fseeko64) is needed to work with large files.
        off_t is 64bit natively on 64bit platforms.

    EXAMPLE

    BUGS
        Not fully compatible with ISO fseeko, especially in 'ab' and 'a+b'
        modes
