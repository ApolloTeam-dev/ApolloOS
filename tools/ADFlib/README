The ADFlib is a free, portable and open implementation of the Amiga filesystem.

It supports :
- floppy dumps
- multiple partitions harddisk dumps
- UAE hardfiles
- WinNT devices with the 'native driver' written by Dan Sutherland
- mount/unmount/create a device (real one or a dump file),
- mount/unmount/create a volume (partition),
- create/open/close/delete/rename/undel a file,
- read/write bytes from/to a file,
- create/delete/rename/move/undel a directory,
- get directory contents, change current directory, get parent directory
- use dir cache to get directory contents.


It is written in portable C, and support the WinNT platform to access
real drives.

unADF is a unzip like for .ADF files :


unadf [-lrcsp -v n] dumpname.adf [files-with-path] [-d extractdir]
    -l : lists root directory contents
    -r : lists directory tree contents
    -c : use dircache data (must be used with -l)
    -s : display entries logical block pointer (must be used with -l)
    -m : display file comments, if exists (must be used with -l)

    -v n : mount volume #n instead of default #0 volume

    -p : send extracted files to pipe (unadf -p dump.adf Pics/pic1.gif | xv -)
    -d dir : extract to 'dir' directory

COMPILATION
-----------

The following commands should automatically detect the system 
configuration and build the library and examples/unadf, 
the ADF extractor binary.

	./autogen.sh
	./configure
	make



FEATURES NEEDING FURTHER TESTS
------------------------------

* Native driver

The NATIV_DIR variable is used to choose the (only one) target platform
of the native driver. The default is :

NATIV_DIR = ./Generic

This one do not give access to any real device. The other one available is
Win32, to access real devices under WinNT.


* Win32DLL

The 'prefix.h' is used to create the Win32 DLL version of the library.
If the WIN32DLL variable is defined in the library code, public functions
are preceded by the '__declspec(dllexport)' directive. If this same
variable is defined, the '__declspec(dllimport)' is put before the functions
prototypes in the 'adflib.h' library include file.
