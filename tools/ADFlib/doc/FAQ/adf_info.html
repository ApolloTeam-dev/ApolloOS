This document describes the .ADF file format. An Amiga Disk File is a sector per
sector dump of an Amiga formatted disk. The intent is to explain in detail how the Amiga stores
files and directories on floppy and hard disks.<BR>
A set of C routines (ADFlib) will be supplied to manage the ADF format.

1. Introduction <BR>
</H2>

In this document, we will describe how the AmigaDOS is (was?) managing
storage media, from the magnetic layer to the files and directories layer.
<P>
With <B>physical layer</B>, I'm talking about the way bytes are physically stored
on a magnetic surface, with the RLL or MFM encoding.<BR>
The next layer, according to the 'most physical' to 'most conceptual' order,
is the <B>partitions layer</B> : this is how the AmigaDOS is managing media with more then
one partition, like Zip disks or hard disks.<BR>
The next and last layer is the <B>volume layer</B> : where the files 
and directories are stored.
<P>
The physical layer is described in the 2nd chapter,<BR>
The volume layer is the biggest part of the document (4th and 5th chapters),
since it's the most interesting,<BR>
The partitions layer is explained in the 6th chapter.
<P>
<P>
Let's continue with more conventional things in an introduction.

1.3 Conventions
</H3>

<P>
In this document, hexadecimal values use the C syntax : for example 0x0c
is the decimal value 12.

<H4>Byte ordering</H4>

<P>
Since the Amiga is a 680x0 based computer, integers that require more than
one byte are stored on disk in 'Motorola order' : the most significant byte
comes first, then the less significant bytes in descending order of
significance (MSB LSB for two-byte integers, B3 B2 B1 B0 for four-byte
integers). This is usually called <B>big endian</B> byte ordering.<BR>
The Intel based PCs are using the <B>little endian</B> byte ordering.

<H4>Vocabulary</H4>

<P>
A 'word' or 'short' is a 2-byte (16 bits) integer, a 'long' a 4-byte (32 bits) integer.
Values are unsigned unless otherwise noted.
<P>
A 'block' in this document will be 512 consecutive bytes on disk,
unless noted otherwise, the variable 'BSIZE' will denote the blocksize. <BR> 
The word 'sector' and
'block' will be used as synonyms here, even if 'sector' is usually related to the
physical side, and the 'block' to the logical side. This is because the AmigaDOS
can only handle one sector per block. Some other Unix filesystems can have more
then one sector per block.
<P>
A block pointer is the number of this block on the disk. The first one is
the #0 block.<BR>
There are 'logical' and 'physical' block pointers. 'Logical' ones are related 
to the start of one volume, 'physical' one are related to the start
of a physical media. If a volume starts at the #0 physical sector, a physical
pointer and a logical pointer is the same thing, like with floppies.
<P>
A simple definition of 'Hashing' could be : "a method to access tables : given a number or a string,
a hash function returns an index into an array". This definition is correct for this
document, but there is a lot of other hashing methods, that might be far more complex.
<P>
Linked lists are cell-oriented data structures. Each cell contains a
pointer to the next or previous cell or both, the last cell pointer is null.

<PRE>
C example :

struct lcell {
	char name[10];
	/* contains next cell adress, or NULL if this cell is the last */
	struct lcell *next_cell;
	};
</PRE>

<P>
Block names begin with a capital (Rootblock).
Field names are noted between quotes ('field_name').

<P>
All formats are described as tables, one row per field. 
Here is an example with the beginning of the well known GIF format :

<PRE>
offset  type   length  name          comments
----------------------------------------------------------
0       char    3      signature     'GIF'
3       char    3      version       '87a' or '89a'
6       short   1      screen width  (little endian)
8       short   1      screen height (little endian)
</PRE>

<P>
The .ADF format is the format created and used by the -incredible- UNIX Amiga Emulator (UAE),
 written by Berndt Schmitt.

<H2>
2. How are bytes physically read from / written to a disk ?
</H2>

<P>The following part deals with the way the Amiga disk controller accesses
the magnetic medium. If you only want to understand the .ADF format, you don't
need to read this part.
<P>
Information is written on disk with magnetic fields. Magnetic fields can be made
'on' or 'off'. But the read/write heads are not capable of detecting directly if a
field is on or off. An encoding is used to store memory bits on the medium.
The CHANGE of fields polarisation will indicate if the bit is 1 or 0.
For Amiga floppy disks (and PC floppies), the encoding scheme is MFM (Modified frequency
modulation).


<H4>
Notes on the Amiga floppy disk controller :
</H4>

<P>
The Amiga floppy disk controller (FDC) which is called 'Paula' is very flexible. It is
capable of reading/writting Amiga/PC/Macintosh/AppleII/C64 3.5 inches
and 5.25 inches floppy disks.
<P>
Paula can read a variable number of bytes from disk, the PC FDC can't. 
The PC FDC uses the index hole to find the beginning of a track, 
Paula uses a synchronization word. 
The Macintosh uses GCR encoding instead of MFM.<BR>
In fact, Paula is simpler than the PC FDC because it does not perform
automatically the decoding just after the read operation, and the encoding just
before the write operation : it must be done by software. The MFM decoding/encoding
is done by hardware with the PC FDC, the Amiga can do GCR or MFM decoding/encoding
because it's done with the CPU. In some versions of the AmigaDOS, 
the decoding/encoding is made by the Blitter custom chip.
<P>
Classic PC FDCs <B>can't read Amiga floppy disks</B> even if they are MFM encoded
on a 3.5 inch floppy, because they can not find the beginning of a track.
This is why the .ADF format has been created.
<P>
However, a custom FDC available on PC machines is capable of reading/writing
Amiga, PC, Macintosh, Atari and C64 floppies !!!
This is CatWeasel :
<A HREF="http://www.jschoenfeld.de/products/cwmk3_e.htm">link</a>
<P>
Paula parametrization for Amiga disks :
<UL>
<LI>MFM encoding
<LI>Precompensation time : 0 nanoseconds
<LI>Controller clock rate : 2 microseconds per bit cell
<LI>Synchronization value : 0x4489
</UL>
<P>
Paula is able to put the read/write heads on a cylinder, and is able
to read with the lower or upper side head. A track of 0x1900 words is usually
read.
<P>

<HR WIDTH=30%>

<A NAME="p21"></A>
<H3>
2.1 What is MFM encoding/decoding ?
</H3>

<P>
The MFM decoding is made by the Amiga CPU, not by Paula. This allows custom
encoding, to protect floppies against copying for example.

<P>
Here follows the MFM encoding scheme :
<PRE>
    user's data bit      MFM coded bits
    ---------------      --------------
        1                   01
        0                   10 if following a 0 data bit
        0                   00 if following a 1 data bit
</PRE>
<P>
User data long words are split in two parts, a part with even bits part first,
followed by a part with odd bits. Once encoded, the amount of data stored
doubles.<BR>
The MFM decoding will transform magnetic fields into computer usuable bits.
<P>
The encoding process will take one long (user's data), and produces 
two longs (MFM coded longs): one for the even bits of the user long,
a second for the odd bits of the user long.<BR>
Vice versa, the decoding process will take the half of two MFM longs to produce
one user's long.
<P>

<HR WIDTH=30%>

<A NAME="p22"></A>
<H3>
2.2 What is the MFM track format ?
</H3>

<P>
Paula will search two synchronization words, and then read 0x1900 words
of data. We will call those 0x1900 words a 'MFM track'.<BR>
There are 80 cylinders on a Amiga floppy disk. Each cylinder has 2 MFM tracks,
1 on each side of the disk.
<P>
Double density (DD) disks have 11 sectors per MFM track, High density (HD) disks
have 22 sectors.
<P>
So a MFM track consists of 11/22 MFM encoded sectors, plus inter-track-gap.
Note that sectors are not written from #0 to #10/21, you must use the 'info'
field to restore the correct order when you read the tracks. Each MFM track begins with
the first sector, and ends with the end of the last sector.<BR>
Each sector starts with 2 synchronization words. 
The synchronization value is 0x4489.
<P>

<HR WIDTH=30%>

<A NAME="p23"></A>
<H3>
2.3 What is the MFM sector format ?
</H3>

From RKRM:
"Per-track Organization:

Nulls written as a gap, then 11 or 22 sectors of data.
No gaps written between sectors."

There are brut data and encoded data.<BR>
Brut data (also called MFM data) doesn't need to be decoded,
this is the synchronization data, the header checksum and data checksum.
<P>
The encoded parts are 'header' and 'data'.
<P>
<P>


Here it comes :

<PRE>
00/0x00	word	2	MFM value 0xAAAA AAAA (when decoded : two bytes of 00 data)

	SYNCHRONIZATION
04/0x04	word	1	MFM value 0x4489 (encoded version of the 0xA1 byte)
06/0x06	word	1	MFM value 0x4489

	HEADER
08/0x08	long	1	info (even bits)
12/0x0c	long	1	info (odd bits)
			decoded long is : 0xFF TT SS SG
				0xFF = Amiga v1.0 format
				TT = track number ( 3 means cylinder 1, head 1)
				SS = sector number ( 0 upto 10/21 )
					sectors are not ordered !!!
				SG = sectors until end of writing (including
					current one)

			Example for cylinder 0, head 1 of a DD disk :
				0xff010009
				0xff010108
				0xff010207
				0xff010306
				0xff010405
				0xff010504
				0xff010603
				0xff010702
				0xff010801
				0xff01090b
				0xff010a0a
                        the order of the track written was sector 9, sector 10,
                         sector 0, sector 1 ...

                        (see also the note below from RKRM)

            Sector Label Area : OS recovery info, reserved for future use

16/0x10	long	4	sector label (even)
32/0x20	long	4	sector label (odd)
                    decoded value is always 0

            This is operating system dependent data and relates to how AmigaDOS
            assigns sectors to files.

            Only available to 'trackdisk.device', but not with any other floppy
            or hard disk device.

	END OF HEADER

48/0x30	long	1	header checksum (even)
52/0x34	long	1	header checksum (odd)
			(computed on mfm longs,
			longs between offsets 8 and 44 
			== 2*(1+4) longs)

56/0x38	long	1	data checksum (even)
60/0x3c	long	1	data checksum (odd)
			(from 64 to 1088 == 2*512 longs)

	DATA
64/0x40	long	512	coded data (even)
576/0x240 long	512	coded data (odd)
1088/0x440
	END OF DATA
</PRE>

<P>

Note from RKRM :
<PRE>
The track number and sector number are constant for each particular
sector. However, the sector offset byte changes each time we rewrite
the track.

The Amiga does a full track read starting at a random position on the
track and going for slightly more than a full track read to assure
that all data gets into the buffer. The data buffer is examined to
determine where the first sector of data begins as compared to the
start of the buffer. The track data is block moved to the beginning
of the buffer so as to align some sector with the first location in
the buffer.

Because we start reading at a random spot, the read data may be
divided into three chunks: a series of sectors, the track gap, and
another series of sectors. The sector offset value tells the disk
software how many more sectors remain before the gap. From this the
software can figure out the buffer memory location of the last byte
of legal data in the buffer. It can then search past the gap for the
next sync byte and, having found it, can block move the rest of the
disk data so that all 11 sectors of data are contiguous.

    Example:

        The first-ever write of the track from a buffer looks
        like this:

        <GAP> |sector0|sector1|sector2|......|sector10|

        sector offset values:

                  11      10      9     .....     1

        (If I find this one at the start of my read buffer, then I
         know there are this many more sectors with no intervening
         gaps before I hit a gap).  Here is a sample read of this
         track:

        <junk>|sector9|sector10|<gap>|sector0|...|sector8|<junk>

        value of 'sectors till end of write':

                  2        1     ....    11   ...    3

        result of track re-aligning:

        <GAP>|sector9|sector10|sector0|...|sector8|

        new sectors till end of write:

                 11       10      9    ...     1

        so that when the track is rewritten, the sector offsets
        are adjusted to match the way the data was written.

3. What is the Amiga floppy disk geometry ?
</H2>

After MFM decoding, you have usuable 'sectors' or 'blocks' into memory.<BR>
<BR>

Here we remind the disk geometries for Double Density disks (DD)
and High Density disks (HD) :<BR>
<PRE>
		bytes/sector	sector/track	track/cyl	cyl/disk
------------------------------------------------------------------------
DD disks	512		11		2		80
HD disks 	512		22		2		80
</PRE>

The relations between sectors, sides and cylinders are for a DD disk :<BR>
<PRE>
Block	sector	side	cylinder
--------------------------------
0	0	0	0
1	1	0	0
2	2	0	0
...
10	10	0	0
11	0	1	0
...
21	10	1	0
22	0	0	1
..
1759	10	1	79
</PRE>

Order = increasing sectors, then increasing sides, then increasing cylinders.<BR>
<P>
A DD disk has 11*2*80=1760 (0 to 1759) blocks,
a HD disk has 22*2*80=3520 blocks.
<P>
The length of .ADF files for a DD disk is therefore 512*11*2*80 = 901120 bytes.<BR>
<P>
Those 'raw' blocks, 512 consecutive bytes, store different 'logical' blocks
to manage files and directories.
<P>
The classic Amiga filesystem has a internal command with one 32 bits wide 
offset parameter (unsigned). It tells where to start the read/write operation.
The biggest size for an Amiga disk is therefore 2^32 = 4 GB.<BR>
Anyway, there exists a 3rd party patch which changes the 32 bits limit 
to 64 bits (on Aminet, disk/misc/ffstd64.lha).
<P>
Jorg Strohmayer added :<BR>
TD64 is an unofficial 3rd party hack. Official solution is NSD (new style device), updates for the 
internal devices and the filesystem are available from 
<A HREF="http://www.amiga.de">http://www.amiga.de</A>.
There is a patch for old (and TD64) devices too (NSDPatch).

4. What is the logical organisation of an Amiga volume ?
</H2>

<P>
A volume is a floppy disk or a hard disk partition.

<P>
The first file system for the Amiga was embedded in the version 1.2 of AmigaDOS.<BR>
With version 2.xx of AmigaDOS the Fast File System (FFS) was introduced, an improved version of
the 1.2, also called old file system (OFS). <BR>
The version 3.0 of AmigaDOS added an international characters mode (INTL) 
and a directory cache mode (DIRC).
<P>
Links are only supported under FFS.
<P>
The start of a floppy volume contains space for sectors which may contain boot code.<BR>
The middle of the volume contains information about
the root (upper most) directory contents and information about free and used blocks.<BR>
Other blocks are of course used to store files and directories.
<P>
The file length, the directory tree depth, the number of entries per directory
are only limited by disk size. (Actually the maximum filesize is
limited to 4 Gbyte sizeof(ulong) which should normally be more than sufficient).
<P>

Let's introduce the logical structures used by the Amiga file system
in a table (for floppies) :
<PRE>
Object		Related logical blocks
------------+----------------------------------------------------------------
Volume		Rootblock, Bitmap block
File		File Header block, Extension block, Data block, Link block
Directory	Rootblock, Directory block, Directory Cache block, Link block
</PRE>
The main data types are a trees and linked lists.<BR>

4.1 What is a Bootblock ?
</H3>

Prior to Kickstart 2.0 the bootblock was hardcoded to consist of the
first two sectors of the floppy disks (sector #0 and #1). As of Kick
2.0, booting via the boot-block could be done with any device driver
and the number of blocks could be changed independantly of the number
of reserved blocks by using BOOTBLOCKS in the DOS environment vector
(DosEnvVec).

<PRE>

                                        The size for a floppy disk is 1012,
                                        for a harddisk it is
                                        (DosEnvVec->Bootblocks * BSIZE) - 12
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>

The DiskType flag informs of the disk format.
<UL>
<LI>OFS = Old/Original File System, the first one. (AmigaDOS 1.2)
<LI>FFS = Fast File System (AmigaDOS 2.04)
<LI>INTL = International characters Mode (see section <A HREF="#p54">5.4</A>).
<LI>DIRC = stands for Directory Cache Mode. This mode speeds up 
	directory listing, but uses more disk space 
(see section <A HREF="#p47">4.7</A>).
</UL>
The Old filesystem may have the international and dircache mode enabled. If
the international mode is enabled, the bit #1 is set. If the dircache is enabled,
its flag is set (bit #2), <B>and the international mode is also enabled, but the
related flag (bit #1) will stay cleared</B>.
The correct values for flag are therefore :
0 (OFS), 1 (FFS), 2 (OFS/INTL), 3 (FFS/INTL), 4 (OFS/DIRC&amp;INTL),
5 (FFS/DIRC&amp;INTL).

<P>
There are few differences between the two file systems :
<UL>
<LI> OFS Datablock stores BSIZE-24 bytes (i.e. normally 488 bytes at
most frequently used BSIZE of 512 bytes), FFS stores BSIZE bytes.
<LI> FFS supports directory caching, links and international mode,
<LI> the FFS is faster than OFS.
</UL>


If the Bootblock starts with the three characters 'PFS', another filesystem
is used in place of AmigaDOS : the Professional File System.
<P>
If the checksum and the DiskType are correct, the system will execute
the bootblock code, at boot time, of course :-).
<P>
The Bootblock code is optional, see <A HREF="#p52">5.2</A> section.
<P>

The Bootblock checksum algorithm follows :
<PRE>
* in 68000 assembler :

	lea 	bootbuffer,a0
        move.l  a0,a1
        clr.l   4(a1)			;clear the checksum
        move.w  #(BOOTBLOCKSIZE/4)-1,d1	;for floppy disks = 1024
                                        ;for hd = (DosEnvVec->Bootblocks * BSIZE)
        moveq   #0,d0
lpchk:  add.l   (a0)+,d0		;accumulation
        bcc.s   jump                    ;if carry set, add 1 to checksum

4.2.1 How to find the first sector of a directory entry ?
</H4>

<P>
Given the name of a file/directory/link you first have to compute its
hash value with this algorithm :
<P>
* The hash function :<BR>

<PRE>
#include&lt;ctype.h&gt;

int HashName(unsigned char *name)
{
unsigned long hash, l;				/* sizeof(int)&gt;=2 */
int i;

l=hash=strlen(name);
for(i=0; i&lt;l; i++) {
        hash=hash*13;
        hash=hash + toupper(name[i]);	/* not case sensitive */
        hash=hash &amp; 0x7ff;
        }
hash=hash % ((BSIZE/4)-56);		/* 0 &lt; hash &lt; 71
                                         * in the case of 512 byte blocks */

return(hash);
}

// this code only works with non international mode disks
// see section <A HREF="#p54">5.4</A>

</PRE>

The <B>toupper()</B> function is the one thing that distinguishes international
from non-international filesystems. There was a bug in old AmigaDOS versions
for this function applied to international caracters (ASCII codes &gt; 128).
A specific toupper() function (see section <A HREF="#p54">5.4</A>) was then 
created available with the 'international mode'.
<P>
The hash value is then used to access HashTable ('ht' field in
Rootblock/Directory block).
<P>
HashTable[ HashValue ] contains the number of the first block of your
object (File header block, Directory block or Link block).
<P>
But different names can result in the same HashValue. If more then one name
has the same HashValue, the other blocks (for files and directory only)
are stored in a chained list. This linked list starts at the
'next_hash' field of the File header or Directory block.
<P>
For example : 'file_1a', 'file_24' and 'file_5u' have the same hash value.
<P>

Here follows the method to find the requested block :

<PRE>
HashValue = HashName( name );
name=uppercase(name);
nsector = Hashtable[ HashValue ];
if (nsector != 0) {
	sector=Load(nsector);		/* reads the 'nsector' sector */
        sector.name = uppercase(sector.name);
        /*
         *  follows the 'same HashValue' chained list if needed
         */
	while ( sector.name != name and sector.Next_hash != 0) {
		sector = Load(nsector);
       	        sector.name = uppercase(sector.name);
	}
	if (sector.name != name)
		puts("File/Dir not found");
}
else
	puts("File/Dir not found");

If, for a new entry, the value at hashTable[hashvalue] is different

already exists in this directory. In one word, in the same-hashValue list,
the addition is made at the tail, not the head.<BR>

<P>
Bitmap blocks contain information about free and allocated blocks.
One bit is used per block. If the bit is set, the block is free, a
cleared bit means an allocated block.
<P>
Bootblock allocation (2 for floppy, for hard disks the value can be
found at DOSEnvVec->Bootblocks) is not stored in bitmap.
Bitmap consists of longs, each describing the status of 32 blocks, where bit 0
corresponds to the lowest block number.

<PRE>

* What is the 'bm_ext' field in Rootblock ?

<P>
If 25 bitmap blocks (which pointers are stored in the Rootblock) are 
not sufficient (for Hard Disks > ca. 50 Mbyte), the pointers to the further

<P>
Files are comprised of a file header block, which contains information about
the file (size, last access time, data block pointers, ...) and the data blocks,
which contain the actual data. The file header block contains up to
BSIZE/4-56 data block pointers (which amounts to 72 with the usual 512 byte 
blocks).

If a file is larger than that, file extension blocks will be allocated to hold 
the data block pointers.

<P>
As with volume names ':' and '/' are forbidden in file names.
<P>
The number of blocks used to store a file depends on the filesystem used,
OFS or FFS. If one file has 7 datablocks, the first is at datablock[71-0],
the last at datablocks[71-6], and highseq equals to 7.
<P>
For the OFS there are two ways of reading the contents of a
file. First by traversing the linked list of data blocks that is
pointed to in first_data (offset 16) and then following the pointers
in each file data block. The other way of accessing the file data is
by using the data_blocks[] table and going backwards through the data
blocks listed there and then the File extension blocks.
<P>
As the FFS doesn't contain extra information in the data blocks (no
pointer list, no checksum) the only way of accessing the file contents
is by going through the data_blocks[] table and the File extension
blocks.
<P>
An empty file consists of just a File header block, with 'byte_size' equal to 0,
and no Data block pointers in 'data_blocks[]'.

In OFS, there is a second way to read a file : using the Data block chained
list. The list starts in File header ('first_data') and goes on with 'next_data'
in each Data block.

In FFS, the only way to read or recover a file is to use data_blocks[]
in the file header block and the File extension blocks. If a File header
or File extension block is unreadable, there is no way to find the
corresponding Data blocks.
<P>
The OFS is more robust than FFS, but slower and can store less data on disk.
As you see, disk salvaging is easier with OFS.
<P>
When a file is deleted, only its File header block number is cleared
from the Directory block (or from the same-hash-value list) and the
bitmap is updated.  File header block, Data blocks and File extension
blocks are not cleared, but the bitmap blocks are updated.
Nevertheless, the undelete operation is easy, as long as these blocks 
are not overwritten.

4.6 How are links implemented in AmigaDOS ?
</H3>

With the FFS, links were introduced. Alas, Commodore blundered again:
soft like where terribly broken, so they removed support for them in
AmigaDOS 3.0. Hard links are seen as files, and hard links to directories
are allowed, which opens the way to endless recursion...
<BR>
In short, the whole implmentation is a mess.
<BR>
However, some shells (like Csh 5.37) support them, so I'm supplying the
structure.

4.7 How are the blocks associated with the directory cache mode ?
</H3>

To speed up directory listing, Directory cache blocks have been created.<BR>
Directory cache blocks are also organised in chained lists.<BR>
The list starts at the directory block (root or normal directory)
with the 'extension' field.

<PRE>
* Directory cache block (BSIZE bytes)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0/0	ulong	1	type		DIRCACHE == 33 (0x21)
4/4	ulong	1	header_key	self pointer
8/8	ulong	1	parent		parent directory
12/c	ulong	1	records_nb	directory entry records in this block
16/10	ulong	1	next_dirc	dir cache chained list
20/14	ulong	1	chksum		normal checksum
24/18	UCHAR	*	records[]	entries list (size = BSIZE-24)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>

The directory entries are stored this way :

This bit tells the shell (which opens its shell-window when booting the

stays there during boot instead of an empty shell-windows (it's a

The toupper() function in the HashName() function (3.2.1 paragraph) is
replaced by the following function with the aim of better handling
international characters :

<PRE>
int intl_toupper(int c)
{
   return (c&gt;='a' && c&lt;='z') || (c>=224 &amp;&amp; c&lt;=254 &amp;&amp; c!=247) ? c - ('a'-'A') : c ;

In the Amiga ASCII table, the international character codes are between
192 and 254. Uppercase caracters are between 192 and 222, the lowercase
versions of them are between 224 and 254. The only exception are the codes 215 and
247, which are respectively the multiply sign and the divide sign.

The Amiga character set is the same as ISO 8859 Latin-1 character set, often
assumed in HTML pages. This character set is described here :

<H4>
* How to find the physical geometry of the disk ?
</H4>

A hard disk is made of several physical disks. They have one head for each
writable side. Each physical disk consists of several tracks, 
which consist of several sectors.
One cylinder is the set of the tracks which have the same number on each disk.
<P>
The total size of the hard disk is expressed in cylinders ('cylinders').<BR>
The size of a cylinder is :<BR>
the number of heads per cylinder ('heads')<BR> 
x the number of sectors per track ('sectors')<BR>
x the size of a block ('block size').
<P>
The 'CylBlocks' field equals to 'heads' x 'sectors'.
<P>
The reserved area is often the 2 first cylinders, between the 'RDB_BlockLo'
block and the 'RDB_BlockHi' block, included. The partitionable area, starts at
the 'LoCylinder' cylinder until the 'HiCylinder' cylinder, included.
<P>
The really last used sector in the reserved area is the sector numbered
'HighRSDKBlock', the first is numbered 0. The SCSI 'hostID' is set to
the id of the SCSI host controller, which is typically 7.
Real SCSI drives ID must be between 0 and 6.
<P>
<P>
The RDSK block is the "root" of the reserved area. It also contains
the first blocks of three linked lists : one the bad blocks
replacement, one for the partition definitions and one last for the
filesystem information.
<P>
Some geometry examples :
<UL>
<LI> a Zip disk : 2891 cylinders, 1 head, 68 sectors,
<LI> my 80Mb Seagate IDE harddisk : 980 cylinders, 10 heads, 17
sectors.
<LI> a 500 Mbyte Fujitsu 2624SA: 1472 cylinders, 11 heads, 63 sectors
<LI> a 50 Mbyte Quantum LPS52: 2085 cylinders, 1 head, 49 sectors

7. The Hard file : a big floppy dump file
</H2>

A hardfile is a file which contains an Amiga volume.
<P>
It is created with WinUAE 
(<A HREF="http://www.winuae.net/">http://www.winuae.net/</A>),
 and not the Amiga and the AmigaDOS. WinUAE is able to 
produce an empty file with random contents of a choosen size, often 
several megabytes long.<BR>
Under WinUAE, a AmigaDOS device appears, associated with the uaehf.device 
(UAE hardfile). You have to format it with the Workbench, and you obtain an
'hardfile'. This volume is then usable inside the emulator by AmigaDOS
(it should also be mountable under Linux with the AFFS filesystem).
<P>
For example a 8Mb hardfile could be mounted on a kickstart 1.3 Amiga with
the following mountlist (from uae docs/README) :
<PRE>
UAE0:  Device = uaehf.device
	   Unit   = 0
	   Flags  = 0
	   Surfaces  = 1
	   BlocksPerTrack = 32
	   Reserved = 1
	   Interleave = 0
	   LowCyl = 0  ;  HighCyl = 511
	   Buffers = 5
	   DosType = 0x444F5300
	   BufMemType = 1
</PRE>
An hardfile is like a floppy disk dump, but bigger : it has a bootblock, 
a rootblock, a bitmap and perhaps dircache blocks.<BR>
The first three bytes of a hardfile is then 'D' 'O' 'S'.
<P>
The geometry is : heads = 1, sectors = 32, 'cylinders' depends the hardfile size.

If you free some blocks by deleting a file, for example, the first next used block
will be the first free block encountered starting from the Rootblock. The just freed
blocks will be reused. It means that when you delete a file and you want to recover
it, don't write anything else to the disk.<BR>
This strategy must have been chosen to minimize fragmentation.

* The order in which data and file extension blocks for a given file are written
  on disk differs with OFS and FFS.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> OFS &amp; FFS : All the data blocks of the file header block are written first.<BR>
<LI> FFS : Then follow all the file extension blocks of the file, then all the
  remaining data blocks are written.<BR>
  OFS : Each file extension block is followed by the related data blocks. So
  the last extension block is followed by the remaining data blocks.<BR>
</UL>
<BR>
  OFS:<BR>
  header -&gt; data blocks -&gt; ext. block -&gt; data blocks -&gt; 
ext. block -&gt; data blocks
<P>
  FFS:<BR>
  header -&gt; data blocks -&gt; all ext. block -&gt; all remaining data blocks
<P>
  -&gt means "followed on disk by"
<P>
This difference is probably the main reason why FFS is faster then OFS.
<P>
Under FFS, the hash chains are sorted by block number.

The AmigaDOS reference manual probably contains a lot of information about Amiga

10. C routines : the ADF library
</H2>

<P>The ADFlib is a portable C library designed to manage Amiga formatted devices like harddisks and
ZIP disks, or dump files of this kind of media via the .ADF format.</P>
<P>The API permits you to :
<UL>
<LI>mount/unmount a device (real one or a dump file),
<LI>mount/unmount a volume (partition),
<LI>create/open/close/delete/move/undelete a file,
<LI>read/write bytes from/to a file,
<LI>create/delete/undelete a directory,
<LI>get directory contents, change current directory, get parent directory.
</UL>

<P>A callback system makes it easy to write a real device driver for any platform. 
The <B>ADFOpus</B> (<A HREF="http://adfopus.sourceforge.net/">
http://adfopus.sourceforge.net/</A>) application 
(a useful Windows Explorer like for ADF files and devices),
written by Dan Sutherlan is able to
access from NT4 an 2.5 inches harddisk formatted under AmigaDOS. <br>
The <b>ADFView</b> Windows Explorer shell extension 
(<a href="http://www.viksoe.dk/code/adfview.htm">http://www.viksoe.dk/code/adfview.htm</a>) written by Bjarke Viksoe
is also using ADFlib.  Hard-disks under W2000 
are also supported.

<P>
See the <A HREF="#p12">1.2 section</A> to see how to obtain the package.<BR>
