        AROS_LH3(LONG, Strlcat,

/*  SYNOPSIS */
        AROS_LHA(STRPTR, destination, A0),
        AROS_LHA(CONST_STRPTR, source, A1),
        AROS_LHA(LONG, size, D0),

/*  LOCATION */
        struct UtilityBase *, UtilityBase, 51, Utility)

/*  FUNCTION
    Appends the string 'source' to the string 'destination'. The total length
    including the terminating NUL is limited to 'size'.
    
    INPUTS
    destination - the target string. Might be NULL.
    source - the string which will be appended. Might be NULL.
    size - the length of the 'destination' buffer
    
    RESULT
    The number of Bytes which would have been written without the truncation.
    
    NOTES

    EXAMPLE
    Strlcpy(buffer, "Hello ", sizeof buffer);
    Strlcat(buffer, "World.", sizeof buffer);
